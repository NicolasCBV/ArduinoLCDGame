# LCD GAME - ARDUINO UNO
## About
This was my first project of my career, made in the pandemic periods. Furthermore, in this time my first contact with programming world begin on coding inside the arduino platform with atmega328p using c++. At 2021 I planned my first project, creating a mini game inside the atmega328p standalone using this prototype platform as a support. In july of 2022 I made a backup of my computer and saved this work on github, now I'm back adding this README and putting this repository in public for who want's start their adventures with atmega328p.

If you wish to test this code on a standalone platform or on one PCB I suggest you to check the image with all circuit to be printed.

Note: sorry if I made any mistakes writing this README, I'm new on english language :)
